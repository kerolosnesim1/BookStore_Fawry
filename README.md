# BookStore Project

This is a simple Java-based simulation of an online bookstore with support for PaperBooks, EBooks, and ShowcaseBooks.

## Main Method Description

The `main` method in `Main.java` demonstrates:
1. Creating a `BookStore` instance.
2. Adding different types of books (PaperBook, EBook, ShowcaseBook).
3. Removing outdated books (older than 4 years).
4. Displaying the current inventory.
5. Attempting to buy a PaperBook by ISBN.
6. Handling stock and availability using exception handling.
7. Printing updated inventory after purchase.
8. Simulating shipping and email services via console outputs.
Let me know if you'd like to include build/run instructions or a GitHub badge section as well.
